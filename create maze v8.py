    v8  - There are some refinements to be made to the maze creation algorithm:
        1. It has been determined that it's best not to roll back the walls created in blocked branches.
            - These blocked paths can be left as open paths for the maze solver to explore.
            - Because of this, all the "rollback" code can be eliminated.
        2. 'lookahead' walls need to be treated differently.
            - The result of making all these "lookahead" walls is many cases the creation of "tunnels" along the solution path,
                where a virtual "tunnel" of walls is created straight to the end.
            - iow there is no place left for the solver to turn off in the wrong direction.
            - Instead of making them actual walls, they will be made as invisible walls so as to not create these tunnels to
                the exit for the maze solver.
            - These invisible walls are not strictly needed by the maze creation algorithm because it is already prohibited from
                turning back upon itself
            - However these invisible walls will mark locations where real ("solidified") walls could possibly be, and in some cases,
                must be added.
            -
            - However in some cases the invisible walls will need to be made into solidified walls where appropriate per the building
                algorithm, just not all of them

        TODO:
        - To make a more efficient job of turning invisible walls into solid walls, the wall creation algorithm should be modified
        to work in a pro-active manner.
        - Instead of creating matched pairs that will be used later to create walls when they are stepped in to, they will be used
        to immediately create walls. In this way invisible walls can also be taken into consideration.  Also it will no longer be
        necessary for a running list of matched pairs to be kept

        TODO: invisible walls:
        1. in original creation, they will need to be checked to see if there are adjacent invis walls.
            - if there are, one of them needs to be made a solidifed wall
        2. later, another check will be done on invis walls
            - if they are in a 4 square block and the other 3 squares are solution path or blocked path, they must be solidified

        TODO: This is the start of part 2, where the rest of the unvisited cells are filled
        - will need to catalog all unvisited squares then attempt to exit when all squares have been visited or made a wall
        - will have to be careful not to overwrite any existing paths and walls
        - it probably won't be able to visit every cell or make it a wall
